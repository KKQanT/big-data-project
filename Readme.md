# Parallelized Clustering Algorithms with PySpark

This project implements three clustering algorithms - KMeans, KMode, KPrototype, and DBSCAN - using both local and global parallelized approach with PySpark. The algorithms are implemented separately and organized into different subdirectories within the repository.

## Clustering Algorithms Implemented

1. **KMeans**: KMeans is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into 'k' clusters based on similarity of features.

2. [**KMode**](https://projects.cs.nott.ac.uk/ppxpj2/big-data-project/-/tree/main/kmode?ref_type=heads): KMode is a clustering algorithm specifically designed for categorical data, where clusters are formed based on the mode of categories. Both local and global implementations are provided in this directory, along with an experimental notebook demonstrating how the size-up and num partition affect runtime. There are also notebooks that includes a step-by-step explanation of implementation.

3. **KPrototype**: KPrototype extends KMeans to handle both numerical and categorical data, allowing for more versatile clustering in mixed data types.

4. **DBSCAN**: DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are closely packed, while marking outliers as noise.


## Kmeans

### File Description

#### notebook
The provided code is an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm using Apache Spark and NumPy. It consists of two main classes: KMeans and a helper class for data conversion.
- The KMeans class contains methods for initializing centroids, finding the closest centroid for a given data point, fitting the K-means model to the data, and transforming new      data points based on the learned centroids.
- The helper class partition_to_numpy_array is used to convert Apache Spark's RDD partition data into NumPy arrays, which are required for the K-means algorithm implementation.
- Additionally, there are two helper functions: get_optimal_kmeans_centroid and get_optimal_kmeans_centroid_with_dummy_key. These functions are used to obtain the optimal            centroids for each partition and to handle the key-value pair format required by Apache Spark's reduceByKey operation.

The notebook includes a section that iterates over different fractions of the input data and different numbers of partitions, performing the parallel K-means clustering and reporting the results.
It's important to note that for small datasets, the overhead of distributed computing may outweigh the benefits of parallelization. However, this implementation can serve as a foundation for handling larger datasets more efficiently in the future.
Note: Please install pyspark and ucimlrepo to run this code.


## KMode
### global approach
![kmode global](assets/KMODE_global.drawio.png)

During the mapping phase, centroids $\mathbf{c^{(k)}}$ are broadcast to worker nodes, and the Hamming distance $D(\mathbf{x^{(i)}}, \mathbf{c^{(k)}})$ between centroids and data points $\mathbf{x^{(i)}}$ is computed. Each data point is hashed into a format facilitating efficient processing in the reduce phase, simplifying mode calculation. The reduce phase aggregates hashed data counts within each cluster, utilizing a reducer function to combine counts.

After computing merged count hashed data for each cluster, representing (cluster, merged count-hash) pairs, they are transmitted to the driver code. Subsequently, new centroids $\mathbf{c^{(k)}}$ are determined by computing mode values based on the aggregated counts. These updated centroids are then broadcast to worker nodes for subsequent iterations.

The iterative process continues until convergence, indicated by the Hamming distance between new and old centroids reaching the stopping criterion of 0, signifying identical centroids.


### local approach
![kmode local](assets/K-Mode-local.drawio.png)

In this approach, we adopt a parallelized strategy where the sequential model learns from each data partition concurrently. Thus, dividing the full dataset into N partitions and selecting K as the number of clusters results in the mapping phase generating NxK centroids as output, transmitted to the driver. These centroids, each representing the mode of clusters within its partition, collectively approximate the behavior of the sequential algorithm. Considering these centroids as a dataset, KMode clustering is performed in the driver code to derive the final centroids for K clusters.

### Files Description

#### experiments_notebook
The notebooks in this folder contain both the Kmode global and local approaches. We also keep versions showing failures and mistakes to demonstrate what we've learned from this project.

**Please refer to `kmode/experiments_notebook/K-Mode-global3.ipynb` and `kmode/experiments_notebook/K-Mode-local2.ipynb` if you want to try out our implementation of the global and local approaches, respectively. The required packages to run our code are provided in requirements.txt.**

- `kmode/experiments_notebook/K-Mode-local.ipynb`: The initial version of the local implementation where there was an issue with `np.apply_along_axis`, resulting in strings having only the first character, leading to incorrect centroids. This has been fixed in `./experiments_notebook/K-Mode-local2.ipynb`.

- `kmode/experiments_notebook/K-Mode-global.ipynb`: The first version of the global implementation, where we simply mapped centroids in the mapping phase and grouped all the data in the reducing phase, then sent them back to the driver to calculate the mode. This was inefficient as it involved a lot of data movement and didn't utilize the reducing process well.

- `kmode/experiments_notebook/K-Mode-global2.ipynb`: The second version of the global implementation, where we counted the number of occurrences of elements within the reducer phase to reduce data movement from the reducer phase to the driver. However, the data movement from the mapping phase to the reducing phase remained the same. We then implemented mini-reducers in the final version `./experiments_notebook/K-Mode-global3.ipynb`.

#### Module
The final implementation has been rewritten in a class object style, but we suggest testing using notebooks for better visibility.

- `kmode/kmode_global.py`: This file contains the global implementation of KMode as a Python class object.

- `kmode/kmode_local.py`: This file contains the local implementation of KMode as a Python class object. In each partition, it uses a sequential KMode object from `kmode_sequential.py` to learn on data in their partition.

### Result

#### Algorithm Approximation

The results from the global and sequential approaches are an exact match; however, the local approach provides only an approximation.

## K-Prototype Global

This is an implementation of the K-Prototype clustering algorithm in PySpark. The K-Prototype algorithm is an extension of the K-Means and K-Mode algorithm that can handle both numerical and categorical data.

### Usage

1. Load your data into a Pandas DataFrame and pass it to the `df` variable. 
2. Define the labels for your data in the `labels` list. order: numerical labels first, followed by categorical labels.
3. Specify the index where the categorical labels start in the `categorical_labels_start_index` variable.
4. Run the code.

### Modifying Categorical Variable Importance

The relative importance given to categorical variables is controlled by the coefficient `0.2` next to the `hamming_distance` function. Increasing this value will give more importance to categorical variables during clustering.

### Using Other Distance Metrics

You can use other distance metrics for numerical and categorical data by modifying the `euclidean_distance` and `hamming_distance` functions, respectively. The new distance functions should follow the same format as the existing ones, returning a numpy array of distances between the input vector and the centroids.
